# Path-planning
This is an application where i implemented an A-star path finding algorithm, and made visualization for the process of finding the shortest path.
I used C++ with Graphics library called SFML.

Here i will show features of this app.

This is main page that pops up on application start

There are three buttons. Map generator button marked means that some tiles will be automatically put on the map randomly.
When entered on the visualization stage, there is possibility of adding and removing obsticles, and changing start and end points on the map.

First Type of visualization is Static mode. This means that the algorithm will execute slowly so that you can see the process of finding shortest path.
